# SENG_401_Group_4

This repository contains group 4's final project for SENG 401 Software Architecture at the University of Calgary in Winter 2022. 

The live website to run this repository will be hosted at https://acafeed.uw.r.appspot.com/ for a limited amount of time. Otherwise, application can be run locally using Python and Django. Before running, it is recommended to run a virtual enironment. From here, you may install the requirements from requirements.txt, and use the command python manage.py runserver to run the Django server locally.

Sample admin login for Acafeed is:

username: mario1

password: password

From this login, you can test administrator functionality such as creating/deleting courses/channels, and banning/unbanning users. Other users can be created through the sign up form on the homepage of the application.
